Backtracking Algorithm
This program uses a backtracking algorithm to find a solution to the N-Queens problem. Backtracking is a systematic way of searching for solutions by trying out different options and undoing them if they lead to a dead-end. The algorithm places queens column by column and backtracks if it finds that the placement violates the rules of the N-Queens problem.
printSolution(board): This utility function takes the solved chessboard configuration and prints it in a human-readable format, displaying the positions of queens as '1' and empty squares as '0'.
solveNQUtil(board, col): This is the recursive utility function that implements the backtracking algorithm. It tries to place a queen in each row of the current column (specified by col). It checks if the queen placement is valid by ensuring it does not attack other queens on the same row, column, or diagonals. If a valid placement is found, the function proceeds to the next column recursively. If a solution is not possible, it backtracks to the previous column and explores other possibilities.
solveNQ(): The main solver function that initializes the chessboard, calls the solveNQUtil function and prints the solution if found. If a solution does not exist, it displays a message stating that no solution was found.
